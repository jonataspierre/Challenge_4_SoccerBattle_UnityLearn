# Challenge 4 - Soccer Battle - UnityLearn

## Challenge Overview: 

Use the skills you learned in a completely different context: the soccer field. 

You will control a ball by rotating the camera around it and applying a forward force, but instead of knocking them off the edge, your goal is to knock them into the opposing net while they try to get into your net. 

After every round a new wave will spawn with more enemy balls, putting your defense to the test. However, almost nothing in this project is functioning! Itâ€™s your job to get it working correctly.

## Challenge Outcome:
- Enemies move towards your net, but you can hit them to deflect them away;
- Powerups apply a temporary strength boost, then disappear after 5 seconds;
- When there are no more enemy balls, a new wave spawns with 1 more enemy;

## Available MVP:
